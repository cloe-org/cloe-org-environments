# 🚀 cloe-org-environments

**Unified Mamba/Conda environments for the entire `cloe-org` ecosystem.**

This repository provides **versioned, ready-to-use Conda/Mamba environment specifications** so you can get started immediately—no cloning required.

---

## 🔧 Quick start

Clone this repository and create the environment directly from GitHub using either `conda` or `mamba` (we strongly recommend `mamba`):

```bash
mamba/conda env create -f ./environments/cloe-org-env-[VERSION].yaml
mamba/conda activate cloe-org-env-[VERSION]
```

Replace `[VERSION]` with your desired release (e.g., `v2026.1`).

## 📦 Project packages

Once the environment is activated, install `cloelib` with the required extras, along with `cloelike`, following the project-specific installation instructions.
